# Trillionnium Chain (TRNM)

**TRNM** is a Rust-native Layer 1 focused on **Decentralized AI Compute** (PoCO).

- Active mainline: `trillionnium/`
- Historical status/archive docs live under `docs/archive/`

---

## 1) Project Positioning

TRNM is a Rust L1 protocol for task-based AI compute settlement and verification. Its core design goals are:

- **PoCO state machine** for task lifecycle: create → commit → reveal → challenge → resolve
- **High-concurrency execution** with conflict detection and grouped scheduling
- **Auditable events + stable interfaces** for integration, replay, governance, and operations
- **Worker Agent + CLI** loop from execution to on-chain submission
- **BL09 retirement-prep wording**: the retained `trnm-pouw` crate name and any residual PoUW fields should be read as migration-era compatibility or provenance/audit evidence, not as ongoing payout authority or a default work-unit payout path

## 3) Core Modules

### Rust mainline (`trillionnium/crates`)

- `trnm-node`: node runtime loop, execution wiring, event emission
- `trnm-state`: versioned state store and `state_root`
- `trnm-pouw`: PoCO task state machine and validation logic (legacy crate name retained during migration; do not read it as current payout-authority wording)
- `trnm-executor`: conflict detection and concurrent scheduling strategy
- `trnm-mempool`: transaction pool and admission/packaging
- `trnm-rpc`: RPC service and stable query APIs
- `trnm-worker-agent`: worker execution and on-chain submission path
- `trnm-cli`: native CLI for tx/query operations
- `trnm-bench`: benchmarking and performance tooling
- `trnm-types`: shared protocol types
- `trnm-bridge-poc`: bridge proof-of-concept integration

### Web4 frontend (`web4-frontend`)

- Next.js app shell (`app/`)
- Contract/API adaptation layer (`lib/`)
- Test suites (unit/component/contract/e2e)
- Release preflight scripts in `web4-frontend/scripts/`:
  - `npm run ci:check`
  - `npm run release:preflight`
  - `npm run release:ready`

---

## 4) Quick Start

### 4.1 Environment

- Rust stable (keep aligned with `rust-toolchain`/CI)
- Node.js 20+
- Git

### 4.2 Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProfAlexQI/TrillionniumChain.git
cd TrillionniumChain
```

### 4.3 Rust mainline smoke

```bash
cd trillionnium
cargo test --workspace
```

### 4.4 Web4 frontend smoke

```bash
cd web4-frontend
npm ci
npm run ci:check
# Force e2e if needed
CI_RUN_E2E=1 npm run ci:check
```

### 4.5 External contracts subtree smoke

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path contracts/Cargo.toml
```

This validates the current `contracts/` MVP workspace only, which today contains `settlement-vault/`, `bridge-relay/`, `governance-guard/`, and `audit-events/`. It should not be read as proof that the target `sdk/`, `runtime-spec/`, `integration-tests/`, or canonical Host ABI/runtime closure already exist in-tree.

## 6) Documentation Entry Points

- Release/truth source entry: [RELEASE_READINESS.md](RELEASE_READINESS.md)
  - When referencing this file, include the current `git rev-parse origin/main` value to avoid using stale commit hashes as current truth.
- Project status log: [docs/archive/root-history/STATUS.md](docs/archive/root-history/STATUS.md)
- Historical roadmap: [docs/archive/root-history/ROADMAP.md](docs/archive/root-history/ROADMAP.md)
- Historical backlog snapshots: [docs/archive/root-history/BACKLOG.md](docs/archive/root-history/BACKLOG.md)
- Unified development scheduling: historical planning boards have existed under archived docs, but if a referenced planning-board file is absent in this checkout, use repository docs under `docs/`, `trillionnium/docs/`, and the subproject READMEs as the live execution entrypoints instead.
- Trillionnium World current development baseline: [docs/development/trillionnium-world-unified-development-doc-v1.md](docs/development/trillionnium-world-unified-development-doc-v1.md). Its current source-of-evidence/incubator is CEX at `/home/qian/.openclaw/workspace/CEX`, synced through CEX head `a8508df fix: gate health metrics on typed receipts`.
- External benchmark comparison: [docs/reports/TRNM_CONCURRENCY_COMPARISON_2026-03-05.md](docs/reports/TRNM_CONCURRENCY_COMPARISON_2026-03-05.md)
- Concurrency bottleneck map + 8-week roadmap: if an older report is referenced from `RELEASE_READINESS.md` but not present in this checkout, treat it as historical only and do not cite it as current local truth.
- Web4 platform overview: if an older master-planning file is absent in this checkout, treat `RELEASE_READINESS.md`, `docs/reports/TRNM_WEB4_PLATFORM_SCORECARD_2026-03-31.md`, `web4-frontend/docs/README.md`, and `web4-frontend/README.md` as the current Web4 truth-source entrypoints.

- `contracts/` status and boundaries: [contracts/README.md](contracts/README.md)
- Historical path note for this perimeter: if an older prompt/doc still says `trillionnium-rust/docs/...` or `contracts-rust/...`, treat that as drift only. The current in-tree truth paths are `trillionnium/docs/...` and `contracts/...`.

## 7) CI / Workflows

The repo runs multiple chain/frontend pipelines under `.github/workflows/`, including:

- `trnm-merge-gates.yml`
- `rust-l1-nightly-health.yml`
- `trnm-gate-quick-check.yml`
- `web4-frontend-ci.yml`

Please run the local minimum gates before creating PRs to reduce CI turnarounds.

---

## 8) Current State Notes (Operational Boundaries)

- Main development entry is `trillionnium/`.
- Historical/archive material in this repo currently lives under `docs/archive/`; do not assume a top-level `legacy/` directory exists in every snapshot.
- Whether the project is currently **release-ready** is defined by [RELEASE_READINESS.md](RELEASE_READINESS.md); historical evidence documents are not automatically equivalent to live state.
- `contracts/` is an **independent Rust-native external-contract subtree / MVP contract scaffolding**. Today it contains 4 landed crates: `settlement-vault/`, `bridge-relay/`, `governance-guard/`, and `audit-events/`.
- `contracts/` is **not yet** the full `sdk / runtime-spec / integration-tests` target layout, and its current crates should not be described as completed Host ABI/runtime integration.
- `audit-events/` under `contracts/` is a shared audit-event schema-adjacent layer; it is not a proof that canonical `sdk`, `runtime-spec`, or `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Host ABI/runtime integration is complete.
- Presence of `contracts/` does **not** by itself move external contracts into Day-1 mainnet minimum scope; that boundary still follows `RELEASE_READINESS.md` plus `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_MAINNET_GAP_MATRIX_2026-03-26.md`.
- When validating or citing this perimeter, prefer current-tree paths and commands, for example `cargo test --manifest-path contracts/Cargo.toml`; do not treat historical `contracts-rust/Cargo.toml` references as live workspace truth.
- Web4 currently uses a read-only API client by default; it falls back to local mock snapshots only when explicitly launched with `?mode=mock`, and write paths are not exposed by default.
- If you see `/api/v0/web4/*` references in docs, treat them as historical naming only; current frontend consumption is around:
  - `query-task`
  - `query-events`
  - `query-capability-audit`
  - `query-normalized-audit-events`

### Read-surface contract (important for integration)

- The following endpoints are the current minimal read contract:
  - `query-task/<task_id>`
  - `query-events/<task_id>?limit=<n>`
  - `query-capability-audit/<subject-or-token>`
  - `query-normalized-audit-events?source=<source>&eventType=<eventType>&cursor=<cursor>&limit=<n>`
- `query-task/<task_id>` prefers persisted state snapshots first, then replay over canonical node event history. Adapter fallback may only enrich `Committed`/`Revealed` views when persisted commit history exists.
- For `query-events/<task_id>`, adapter fallback is strictly bounded/deduplicated to recent commit/reveal tails; it must not invent pre-commit history.
- For durable indexer/archive replica planning, persist canonical node event streams rather than relying long-term on adapter fallback.
- Reference: [TRNM_DAY1_PUBLIC_READ_CONTRACT_2026-04-03.md](trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_DAY1_PUBLIC_READ_CONTRACT_2026-04-03.md) and [TRNM_DAY1_PUBLIC_READ_CONTRACT_MATRIX_2026-04-03.md](trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_DAY1_PUBLIC_READ_CONTRACT_MATRIX_2026-04-03.md)
- These two documents freeze the **Day-1 minimum public read surface only**, not full durable-indexer/archival read-model readiness.
- `query-events/<task_id>` defaults to `100` and hard-caps at `500`; no assumption of infinite window.
- `query-events/<task_id>` currently accepts only one `limit` key. Unknown keys, duplicated `limit`, case variants (`Limit=`), empty values, or query smuggling are fail-closed.
- `query-capability-audit/<subject-or-token>` supports both capability token and subject DID.
- `query-normalized-audit-events` currently accepts only `source / eventType / cursor / limit`; unknown keys, repeated keys, case variants (`Limit=` / `Source=` / `eventtype=` / `Cursor=`), empty values, and smuggling are fail-closed.
- Paths with a single trailing slash are accepted for:
  - `query-task/<id>/`
  - `query-events/<id>/`
  - `query-capability-audit/<subject>/`
  - but **not** for `query-normalized-audit-events/` (currently exact path only).
- For `query-events/<id>/`, the `limit` query contract is unchanged: `?limit=<n>` still parses normally, default remains `100`, and the same fail-closed rules apply.
- All read endpoints remain fail-closed for extra segments, raw/encoded slash tricks, and query/fragment smuggling.

### Explorer scaffold (operator-facing)

Current explorer service in this repo is an operator-facing scaffold, not a production durable indexer.

Typical commands (run from repo root):

```bash
./trillionnium/scripts/v2/explorer_service_up.sh
./trillionnium/scripts/v2/explorer_service_status.sh
./trillionnium/scripts/v2/explorer_service_down.sh
```

Or from inside `trillionnium/`:

```bash
./scripts/v2/explorer_service_up.sh
./scripts/v2/explorer_service_status.sh
./scripts/v2/explorer_service_down.sh
```

- Service status defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8090/healthz`.
- Environment overrides: `EXPLORER_HOST`, `EXPLORER_PORT`, `EXPLORER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `EXPLORER_HEALTH_URL`, and `EXPLORER_RPC_BASE_URL`.
- If `trillionnium/run/explorer-service/explorer-service.env` exists, the scripts load it automatically and preserve it as the operator-local source of truth across `up` / `status` / `down`.
- For external exposure, prefer loopback-bound bind + reverse proxy, and keep the emitted `local_health_url` as the local liveness target even when `public_base_url` points at a proxy-facing URL.
- `explorer_service_status.sh` reports `pid_file`, `log_file`, `public_base_url`, `health_url`, `local_health_url`, `rpc_base_url`, and explicitly marks `service_mode=operator-facing-static-scaffold`, `production_ready=false`.
- To capture one deterministic operator handoff packet for this scaffold, use:

```bash
./trillionnium/scripts/v2/capture_explorer_scaffold_handoff.sh
```

- That helper is intentionally **placeholder-only**. It preserves blocker markers such as `deployment_evidence_scope=placeholder-only`, `rank1_read_surface_blocker=still-open`, and `durable_indexer_status=not-implemented-in-this-scaffold`, and it rejects drift if fetched `index.json` no longer matches the scaffold contract.
- The emitted `summary.txt` is also a template-boundary packet, not just a file list. Reuse `template_selection`, `durable_template_allowed`, `durable_template_rejection_reason`, and every `truth_source_*` line verbatim instead of paraphrasing the scaffold into a durable-service handoff.
- Build the packet from `explorer_service_status.sh` output first, then reuse the emitted `index_url`, `health_url`, and `local_health_url` instead of hand-typing proxy/local URLs from shell memory. If you also fetch a reverse-proxy/public URL, attach it as separate evidence rather than replacing the local status-driven proof.
- When the public URL and local bind target differ, preserve the emitted `local_index_url` and `local_index_fetch_command` from `summary.txt` too. Do not reconstruct the local `/index.json` path by editing the public URL by hand.
- Current scaffold intentionally keeps durable-read anchors fail-closed:
  - `ingestion_source`
  - `checkpoint_store`
  - `replay_start_anchor`
  - `retention_scope`
  - `archive_owner`
  - `lag_slo`
- In handoff notes, include flags such as:
  - `deployment_evidence_scope=placeholder-only`
  - `rank1_read_surface_blocker=still-open`
  - `durable_indexer_status=not-implemented-in-this-scaffold`
  - `durable_read_anchor_complete=false`
- Use `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_EXPLORER_SCAFFOLD_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE_2026-04-04.md` for this scaffold path.
- Operator bring-up / reverse-proxy / systemd details live in `trillionnium/docs/runbooks/explorer-service-scaffold.md`; use that runbook to keep `health_url` and `local_health_url` aligned with the same deployed instance you hand off.
- Do **not** switch to `TRNM_DURABLE_READ_SERVICE_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE_2026-04-04.md` until all six durable-read anchors exist, replay/restore/lag evidence is attached in the same packet, and `summary.txt` reports `durable_template_allowed=true`.
- When the lane moves beyond placeholder scaffold work, the next implementation boundary is `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_RANK1_IMPLEMENTATION_DESIGN_PACKET_2026-04-05.md`, which defines the durable indexer/read-model path rather than more scaffold polish.

Only switch to durable handoff templates when all six durable-read anchors are truly implemented.
