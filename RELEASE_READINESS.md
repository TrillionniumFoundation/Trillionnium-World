# TRNM Release Readiness

Updated date: 2026-05-17
Scope: When citing this file, you must always record the current output of `git rev-parse origin/main`. Do not keep using a fixed commit hash from an older doc header as a permanent truth source.

> This file is the active **release readiness truth source**.
> In release, RC, or handoff contexts, it must be cited together with the contemporaneous `origin/main` commit so stale snapshots are not mistaken for current conclusions.
> - `docs/archive/root-history/STATUS.md`: historical progression log / working journal, not used for current release determination.
> - `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_MASTER_UNIFIED_2026-03-04.md`: scheduling board for development, not release truth.
> - `docs/archive/web4-history/GO_READY_EVIDENCE_WEB4_2026-03-03.md` and `docs/archive/web4-history/web4-fix-sequence-2026-03-04-evidence.md`: represent a historical fix/pass batch, not today's global release posture.

## Current Conclusion

**Conclusion: Not release-ready; do not claim external readiness.**

The repo has useful local gates, reusable partial evidence packs, and front-end pre-release checks, but there are still active risks of truth-source drift.

Boundary clarification:
- `RELEASE_READINESS.md` answers the question "is this current repository snapshot currently expressible as release-ready / externally publishable?".
- `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_MAINNET_GAP_MATRIX_2026-03-26.md` answers: if the goal is **public mainnet launch**, which P0/P1 blockers still remain.
- Therefore, a local RC rehearsal pass, full validator handoff evidence, or a single GO-ready sub-route cannot by itself be treated as public mainnet readiness.

Current major drift risks include:

1. `docs/archive/root-history/STATUS.md` still describes the 2026-02-21 state from a "releasable baseline" perspective, but that framing is now stale.
2. The root `README.md` historically pointed preflight scripts to root-level `scripts/*.sh`; those paths are no longer in use. They now live in `web4-frontend/scripts/`.
3. Web4 documentation saying GO-ready / PASS is historical evidence and cannot be interpreted as current, repository-wide release-ready status.
4. Legacy verifier PoC assets (`rust/verifier`, `scripts/run_rust_verifier_poc.sh`) are not present; documents implying an always-present in-repo verifier now overstate current capability.
5. Web4 current semantics are **readonly API client + explicit mock fallback**: the UI attempts readonly query path by default, and only falls back to local snapshots under explicit `?mode=mock`. Do not describe it as a purely static mock page, and do not describe it as a production write-enabled backend.
6. `/api/v0/web4/*` references are historical V0 naming. There is no corresponding Next.js route currently; effective read semantics come from `web4-frontend/lib/api-contract/*` and `web4-frontend/lib/dashboard/source.ts`.
7. Concurrency closeout and external comparisons are still in document-consolidation phase: `docs/reports/TRNM_CONCURRENCY_BOTTLENECK_MAP_AND_8W_ROADMAP_2026-03-10.md` is the current bottleneck map and 8-week route entry, `docs/reports/TRNM_CONCURRENCY_COMPARISON_2026-03-05.md` is an external benchmark draft; both describe progress, not release proof.
8. Trillionnium World release-review handoff gates can be green for local review while public launch remains blocked. Treat `release_review_ci_gate_green_with_public_launch_blockers` as a local review packet result, not external readiness.
9. Trillionnium World client/account work can drift back to the old CEX web runtime if the boundary is not checked. The native playable client is `trillionnium/crates/trnm-world-bevy`; CEX is legacy adapter evidence only.

## Component Status

### 1. Rust L1 / Mainchain
- **Status**: Development in progress. Many gate, replay, benchmark, and nightly scripts/documents exist.
- **Confirmed facts**: Release-related scripts such as `trillionnium/scripts/release_rc.sh` and `trillionnium/scripts/run_local_release_evidence.sh` are present.
- **Do not claim**: the repository as a whole is globally release-ready.

### 2. Web4 Frontend
- **Status**: Independent npm preflight chain exists. Frontend behavior is readonly query client with fail-closed handling; in dev/demo mode it can explicitly use mock fallback.
- **Confirmed facts**: `web4-frontend/package.json` contains `ci:check` / `release:preflight` / `release:ready`, which call scripts in `web4-frontend/scripts/`; `web4-frontend/lib/api-contract/client.ts` currently consumes `GET /query-task/:taskId`, `GET /query-events/:taskId`, and `GET /query-capability-audit/:subject`.
- **Limitation**: Historical GO-ready docs exist; no implementation exists for `/api/v0/web4/*` inside this repo, so it is incorrect to characterize Web4 as broadly production-ready or as an in-repo dashboard API write backend.

### 3. Verifier / Sidecar
- **Status**: Legacy Rust verifier PoC core is not present in this repository.
- **Confirmed missing pieces**: `rust/verifier`, `scripts/run_rust_verifier_poc.sh`, and `docs/protocol/rust-verifier-poc.md` are currently absent.
- **Narrative boundary**: it is acceptable to describe this as "historical cross-check / evidence recording path", but not as an in-repo verifier subsystem currently complete.
- **For P1.3 closure assessment**: use `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_VERIFIER_DA_CHECKPOINT_SIDECAR_CLOSURE_2026-03-31.md` and evaluate deployable boundary, DA checkpoint linkage, failure taxonomy, and replay evidence. This is a closure checklist, not a release-ready proof.

### 4. Trillionnium World Release Review Handoff (local gate, not public readiness)
- **Status**: Local release-review handoff packet is available, but public launch is still blocked on real external evidence.
- **Primary local aggregate command**: `scripts/check_trillionnium_world_release_review_ci_gate.sh`.
- **Client boundary gate**: `scripts/check_trillionnium_world_client_boundary.sh` verifies that manual playtest and future game account entry target `trnm-world-bevy`, while CEX remains evidence/reference only.
- **Current aggregate artifact**: `acceptance/S6_public_launch/latest/release-review-ci-gate.json`.
- **Contract**: `trillionnium_world_release_review_ci_gate_v1`.
- **Expected local status while blockers remain**: `release_review_ci_gate_green_with_public_launch_blockers`.
- **Current interpretation**: `ready_for_release_review=true`, `public_launch_ready=false`, `android_s5_real_device_claimed=false`, and proof scope is host-side Native/Bevy local playability, texture sampling/correlation, render-asset eligibility, and CEX adapter readiness only. Classic low-spec RTS readiness is included inside host-side Native/Bevy local playability.
- **What it proves**: packet integrity, static release-review guards, README links, workflow script refs, release quickcheck/signoff summary semantics, CEX adapter readiness, and Native/Bevy host-side local playability evidence are connected for review handoff. That local evidence currently includes keyboard replay, action coach, player HUD/debug layer, classic low-spec playtest readiness with RTS control-loop evidence, live-window screenshot sequence, sprite texture sampling, sampled texture live-window correlation, render asset eligibility, public-launch local-playability consumption, and CEX production adapter readiness artifacts.
- **What it does not prove**: Android S5 real-device launch/FPS/lifecycle/crash-free readiness, production/public map-pack readiness, first beta cohort evidence, commercial launch drill evidence, multi-node or live-traffic latency, or public-network live exposure.
- **Still required before public launch readiness**: S5 Android real-device matrix, production map-pack public evidence, first beta cohort evidence, commercial launch drill evidence, multi-node/live-traffic latency evidence, and public-network live exposure evidence.

   - Web4 subproject: `web4-frontend/README.md`
9. **RC / validator handoff operations**: `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_VALIDATOR_RELEASE_HANDOFF.md`.
   - Use when passing `testnet_preflight.sh`, `run_local_release_evidence.sh`, and `release_rc.sh` artifacts between operator / validator hands.
   - Scope: artifact path parsing, identity-field checks, replay/rollback references; **does not** replace this file's release conclusion.
10. **Public mainnet blocker interpretation / P0-P1 sequencing**: `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_MAINNET_GAP_MATRIX_2026-03-26.md`.
   - Use when answering what remains for public mainnet, what is a launch blocker, and the minimum Day-1 trust scope.
   - Scope: closure matrix for mainnet, not equivalent to any single local RC run passing.
11. **Minimal mainnet observability pack and alert + incident handoff conventions**: `trillionnium/docs/runbooks/mainnet-observability-alerting-starter-pack.md`, plus oracle-specific guidance from `trillionnium/docs/runbooks/oracle-observability-alerts.md`.
   - Use for severity/signal/needs_replay/needs_rollback tags, minimal dashboard bundle, first-stop panel, and handoff replay/rollback pointers.
   - Scope: shared starter pack and on-call semantics, not observability P0 closure, and not full release readiness.
12. **Collapse 36-lane execution into a GO-NO-GO launch-distance panel**: `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_PUBLIC_MAINNET_GO_NO_GO_PANEL_2026-04-04.md`.
   - Use when answering how far current local execution is from public launch, which items are hard blockers, and what can move after Day-1.
   - Scope: status panel over current lane snapshot, not global release-ready proof.
13. **Classify MN01 residuals**: whether remaining hunks are unmerged work or already absorbed/superseded by mainline: `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_MN01_RESIDUAL_CLOSURE_2026-04-05.md`.
   - Use when deciding what in `lane/mn01-peer-bootstrap-topology` still requires manual absorption and why many `git cherry -v` plus signs are semantically mostly already covered by mainline.
   - Scope: lane residual closure; does not replace this file.
14. **Reassess public-mainnet distance from current local integrated main** (including unpushed local absorptions): `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_MAINNET_READINESS_REASSESSMENT_2026-04-05.md`.
   - Use when evaluating where local `main` currently sits relative to public launch and which blockers remain on the shortest path.
   - Scope: requires pair-citing local main and remote main commits; does not imply remote `origin/main` is already at same conclusion.
15. **Convert local integrated main residual distance into executable closing packages / exit criteria / evidence packets / first execution slice**: `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_MAINNET_CLOSURE_EXECUTION_BOARD_2026-04-05.md`.
   - Use to move from "what remains" to concrete closure packages and sequencing.
   - Scope: execution board, not a release conclusion.
16. **Prioritize Rank-1 shortest honest first slice (public read surface / indexer / explorer)**: `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_RANK1_FIRST_EXECUTION_SLICE_2026-04-05.md`.
   - Use to define what is already frozen, what is still non-binding, and how placeholder versus durable boundaries are decided in practice.
   - Scope: only the first slice; not Rank-1 closed, and does not claim durable indexer/historical read model/explorer backend completion.
17. **Decide durable boundary candidate direction for six durable-read anchors**: `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_RANK1_DURABLE_BOUNDARY_DECISION_MEMO_2026-04-05.md`.
   - Use when asking how to proceed from Rank-1 first slice and how to turn remaining placeholders into an implementation path.
   - Scope: decision memo only; not a proof of closure.
18. **Convert durable-boundary direction into implementation design package** (schema / ingest loop / replay bootstrap / lag formula / retained-surface materialization): `trillionnium/docs/release/TRNM_RANK1_IMPLEMENTATION_DESIGN_PACKET_2026-04-05.md`.
   - Use for implementation approach from rpc-pull + sqlite + genesis replay to concrete MVP; does not mean Rank-1 is closed.
19. **Trillionnium World local release-review handoff aggregate**: `scripts/check_trillionnium_world_release_review_ci_gate.sh` and artifact `acceptance/S6_public_launch/latest/release-review-ci-gate.json`.
   - Use when asking whether the local review packet, packet integrity, guards, README links, and workflow refs are connected.
   - Scope: local review handoff only; does not replace this file's overall "not release-ready" conclusion and does not claim Android S5 real-device or public launch readiness.
20. **Trillionnium World release-review WIP checkpoint manifest**: `scripts/check_trillionnium_world_release_review_checkpoint_manifest.sh` and artifacts `acceptance/S6_public_launch/latest/release-review-checkpoint-manifest.json` / `.md`.
   - Use before committing the current large WIP tree; it groups dirty paths into review/commit slices and snapshots release-review plus CEX adapter evidence.
   - Scope: working-tree organization only; it stages nothing, commits nothing, and does not replace real public-launch evidence.

## RC Rehearsal Evidence Template (non-release)

> Goal: run rollback-friendly RC readiness rehearsals only; no release tagging or publishing.

- **CI / gate command**: record the exact command with exit code for each run. Prefer a deterministic prefix such as `env TZ=UTC LC_ALL=C LANG=C SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1704067200`.
  - Rust example: `env TZ=UTC LC_ALL=C LANG=C SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1704067200 cargo test -p trnm-rpc --test reliability_persistent_smoke -- --nocapture`
- **Deterministic rerun**: run each critical gate at least twice with identical command and environment; single green runs can hide flake.
- **Replay evidence**: persist both input snapshot and output summary location, e.g. `trillionnium/run/health/evidence-<timestamp>/`, and include UTC timestamp with `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`.
- **Replay command source**: if using `run_local_release_evidence.sh`, cite `replay_command=` from `summary.txt` directly. Do not rewrite it manually without the deterministic wrappers.
- **Environment interpretation**: fields under `env_*` in `summary.txt` reflect live shell environment; authoritative replay baseline is `replay_env_*`.
- **challenge reexec fields**: when citing challenge reexec-related values, preserve both `replay_env_trnm_challenge_reexec_entry=` and `challenge_reexec_entry=` verbatim, including `<entry_not_found>` if unresolved.
- **RC manifest boundary**: if citing `manifest.txt` generated by `trillionnium/scripts/release_rc.sh`, include `truth_source`, `historical_evidence_only=true`, and `evidence_scope` together; do not present gate outputs as current release proof.
- **Artifact identity consistency**: when comparing `summary.txt` and `manifest.txt`, verify identity fields match exactly (`git_branch`, `git_head`, `git_head_state`, `git_worktree_path`, `git_worktree_branch_ref`, `git_expected_worktree_branch_ref`, `git_worktree_branch_ref_match`). `git_worktree_branch_ref_match` must be true.
- **No false binding by timestamp**: a latest path such as `run/health/evidence-*` is not sufficient proof of lane identity; check worktree path/branch against ticket-specified values.
- **Prefer fail-closed helpers**: for handoff and audit, use `./trillionnium/scripts/v2/extract_release_handoff_fields.sh --expected-worktree-root <ticket-path> --expected-branch-ref <ticket-branch>` (or from `trillionnium/` as `./scripts/v2/extract_release_handoff_fields.sh ...`). This helper accepts short branch names or full refs.
- **Record helper output**: always tee helper output to an auditable file (for example `trillionnium/run/preflight/handoff-fields-<timestamp>.txt`) and cite from that artifact.
- **Lane binding from ticket values**: lane validation must be run with ticket-provided `--expected-worktree-root` and `--expected-branch-ref` via `verify_lane_worktree.sh` before handoff; do not backfill from current shell assumptions.
- **Rollback command**: every run should include a single rollback line in notes, e.g. `git revert <commit>` or `git checkout -- <file>` for docs.
- **Root-cause tags**: use consistent labels on failure (recommended: `CI_FLAKE`, `ENV_DRIFT`, `DOC_DRIFT`, `MISSING_FIXTURE`, `NON_DETERMINISTIC_TEST`).

Recommended release update annotation in each commit note: include fixed fields `gate`, `evidence`, `rollback`, `root_cause` for automation.

## Remaining deferred items / not addressed in this rewrite

1. No full-repo release gate rerun was executed in this documentation pass.
2. Not every historical document was rewritten; only docs most likely to misstate current readiness were normalized to reduce external confusion.
3. No code or release script behavior changed; this pass only aligned truth-source and documentation framing.
